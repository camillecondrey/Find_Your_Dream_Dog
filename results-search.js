    <h4 class="card-title">American Pit Bull Terrier</h4>
    <p class="card-text">The American Pit Bull Terrier is a companion and family dog breed. Originally bred to bait bulls, the breed evolved into all-around farm dogs, and later moved into the house to become nanny dogs because they were so gentle around children. Their tenacity, gameness, and courage make them popular competitors in the sports of weight pulling, agility, and obedience competition. These dogs love to snuggle and play and will be a loyal companion for life.

    <h4 class="card-title">Labrador Retriever</h4>
    <p class="card-text">The Labrador Retriever was bred to be both a friendly companion and a useful working dog breed. Historically, he earned his keep as a fisherman's helper: hauling nets, fetching ropes, and retrieving fish from the chilly North Atlantic. Today's Labrador Retriever is as good-natured and hard working as his ancestors, and he's America's most popular breed. These days the Lab works as a retriever for hunters, assistance dog to the handicapped, show competitor, and search and rescue dog, among other canine jobs.
